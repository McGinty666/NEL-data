Flow meters in pipelines have their accuracy affected by upstream disturbances to flow, eg bends or partially close valves.
These cause the velocity profile over a cross section to deviate from "fully developed" flow conditions which occurs after sufficient lengths of straight pipe run.
Some authors suggest and excess of 100 Diamters as required.

However to some some extent, (some better than others) flow meters can in their flow calculation can compensate for the deviation from ideal conditions. 

This data shows for various setups the error at 0, 5 and 10 Diameters. I don't know what this was validated against, I just came across the xlsx file.
The python code creates the graphs from the raw data in the .xlsx file.
